Queens, New York otherwise known as the worldâ€™s borough is home to one of the most diverse communities globally. With a population of over 2.2 million people and over 800 different spoken languages, cultures mesh every day to create a united and powerful community. A dilemma that citizens of Queens often face is an obscure language barrier, trouble communicating with others and understanding signs and billboards around them. This project hopes to bring a fun solution to this situation by creating a C++ Language education program intended for the diverse population of Queens, New York to learn a large variety of conversational and vital phrases in the borough's 6 most spoken languages.
